My favourite movie is inception. I was mind bogling movie. I like leonardo di caprio movies. Like Shutter Island, departed ,etc.
I also liked The Matrix, lucy ,etc. I like all sci-fi movies with action.

### My favourite Anime
I love haikyuu, Its about volleyball. It is fantastic. In a sport where height is considered as the biggest weapon but the main character is determined not to let height get in his way. 3rd season was amazing as their opponents were individually very much stronger, they went to nationals multiple times. But, they used combinations, time-lag, quicks and many other differents attacks to overhelm their opponenets. I loved it. I have watched this anime multiple times. <br>

I love Full Metal Alchamist. It sci-fictional fantasy series. There is alcemy which is a sort of science which could disintegrate molecules into its basic form and create something new out of it, but it has a limitations that it cannot reserrect dead. It is one of the the most engaging anime of all time.
